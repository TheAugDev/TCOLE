                    answer: "No, the gain enhancement seems tied to acquiring interest or speculation.",
                    explanation: "Sec. 39.06(g) enhances 'an offense under this section' if it 'results in a net pecuniary gain'. While (a)(3) is under the section, the gain is typically linked to (a)(1), (a)(2), (b), or (c) where information is used for financial advantage or speculation. Coercion itself doesn't directly generate pecuniary gain in the same way, making the base F3 penalty likely applicable."
