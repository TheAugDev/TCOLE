                    question: `Under Sec. 9.01, 'Deadly Force' is force that is intended/known to cause, or in its manner of use is *capable* of causing...`,

                    answer: `Death or serious bodily injury.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.01(3) defines it as force *capable* of causing death or SBI, which is a broad definition.`
                },
                {
                    question: `Under Sec. 9.02, justification under this chapter is what type of defense?`,
                    options: [`An affirmative defense.`, `A defense.`, `A mitigating factor at punishment.`, `A defense only for felonies.`],
                    answer: `A defense.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.02 states 'It is a defense...'. This is legally distinct from an 'affirmative defense,' which has a different burden of proof.`
                },
                {
                    question: `Under Sec. 9.03 (Confinement), if an actor justifiably confines someone, what must they do?`,
                    options: [`Keep them confined for at least one hour.`, `Notify the police immediately.`, `Take reasonable measures to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows he safely can.`, `Do nothing, the confinement is fully justified.`],
                    answer: `Take reasonable measures to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows he safely can.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.03 requires reasonable measures to end the confinement safely, unless the person has been arrested.`
                },
                {
                    question: `According to Sec. 9.04 (Threats), does producing a weapon and threatening to shoot constitute the use of deadly force?`,
                    options: [`Yes, always.`, `Only if the weapon is loaded.`, `No, as long as the actor's purpose is limited to creating an apprehension that he will use deadly force if necessary.`, `Yes, because the weapon is capable of causing death.`],
                    answer: `No, as long as the actor's purpose is limited to creating an apprehension that he will use deadly force if necessary.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.04 explicitly states that a threat, even with a weapon, is not 'the use of deadly force' if the purpose is just to create apprehension.`

                    question: `Under Sec. 9.05, an actor justifiably uses force against Person A, but recklessly kills Person B (an innocent third person). Is the justification available in a prosecution for killing Person B?`,
                    options: [`Yes, the justification applies to all conduct at that time.`, `Yes, under the 'transferred intent' doctrine.`, `No, the justification is unavailable in a prosecution for the reckless killing of the innocent third person.`, `No, unless the actor was a peace officer.`],
                    answer: `No, the justification is unavailable in a prosecution for the reckless killing of the innocent third person.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.05 makes it clear that justification does not cover the reckless injury or killing of an innocent third party.`
                },
                {
                    question: `If an actor's conduct is justified under Chapter 9, does this prevent the "victim" from suing the actor in civil court (Sec. 9.06)?`,
                    options: [`Yes, justification is a complete bar to all criminal and civil actions.`, `No, the fact that conduct is justified does not abolish or impair any civil remedy.`, `Only if the actor was found 'not guilty' at a criminal trial.`, `Only if the 'victim' was committing a felony.`],
                    answer: `No, the fact that conduct is justified does not abolish or impair any civil remedy.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.06 states that civil remedies are unaffected. A person can win a self-defense claim criminally but still be found liable civilly.`
                },
                {
                    question: `Under Sec. 9.21 (Public Duty), when is the use of *deadly force* justified?`,
                    options: [`Whenever a peace officer deems it necessary.`, `When the actor reasonably believes it is authorized by a court order.`, `When it is to prevent any felony.`, `When the actor reasonably believes it is *specifically required by statute* or occurs in the lawful conduct of war.`],
                    answer: `When the actor reasonably believes it is *specifically required by statute* or occurs in the lawful conduct of war.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.21(c) sets a very high bar for deadly force under 'public duty,' requiring specific statutory authorization or the conduct of war.`
                },
                {
                    question: `Which of the following is *NOT* one of the three required elements for the 'Necessity' defense under Sec. 9.22?`,
                    options: [`The actor reasonably believes the conduct is immediately necessary to avoid imminent harm.`, `The desirability of avoiding the harm clearly outweighs the harm of the conduct.`, `A legislative purpose to exclude the justification does not otherwise plainly appear.`, `The actor did not provoke the situation.`],
                    answer: `The actor did not provoke the situation.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.22 lists three elements: (1) immediately necessary for imminent harm, (2) the harm avoided outweighs the harm caused, and (3) no legislative exclusion. Provocation is not an element of this defense.`
                },
                {
                    question: `Under Sec. 9.31 (Self-Defense), when is an actor's belief that *force* was immediately necessary *presumed* to be reasonable?`,
                    options: [`Anytime they are in their own home.`, `When the other person insulted them.`, `When the other person unlawfully and with force entered the actor's occupied vehicle.`, `When the other person was committing any class of theft.`],
                    answer: `When the other person unlawfully and with force entered the actor's occupied vehicle.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.31(a)(1)(A) creates this presumption for unlawful, forcible entry into an actor's occupied habitation, *vehicle*, or place of business/employment.`
                },
                {
                    question: `Which of the following *negates* (is NOT justified) the use of force in self-defense under Sec. 9.31(b)?`,
                    options: [`In response to verbal provocation alone.`, `When the other person is committing trespass.`, `To protect a third person.`, `When the actor failed to retreat.`],
                    answer: `In response to verbal provocation alone.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.31(b)(1) explicitly states that the use of force is *not* justified in response to verbal provocation alone.`
                },
                {
                    question: `An actor knows a peace officer is arresting him. The arrest is unlawful, but the officer uses no force. The actor resists with force. Is the actor's use of force justified under Sec. 9.31(b)(2)?`,
                    options: [`Yes, because the arrest is unlawful.`, `No, because the actor knows it is a peace officer, and the officer has not used greater force than necessary.`, `Yes, a person always has a right to resist an unlawful arrest.`, `Only if the actor is not committing a crime.`],
                    answer: `No, because the actor knows it is a peace officer, and the officer has not used greater force than necessary.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.31(b)(2) forbids resisting an arrest you know is by a PO, even if unlawful, *unless* the resistance is justified under 9.31(c) (resisting excessive force).`
                },
                {
                    question: `When is an actor justified in using force to resist an arrest under Sec. 9.31(c)?`,
                    options: [`Anytime the arrest is unlawful.`, `If, *before* the actor offers resistance, the officer uses or attempts to use greater force than necessary.`, `If the actor believes the officer is mistaken.`, `If the actor has not been read their rights.`],
                    answer: `If, *before* the actor offers resistance, the officer uses or attempts to use greater force than necessary.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.31(c) provides this narrow exception: you can only resist the *excessive* force, not the arrest itself, and only *after* the officer uses it first.`
                },
                {
                    question: `An actor is legally present at a park, is not engaged in criminal activity, and did not provoke a fight. Is the actor required to retreat before using *force* (non-deadly) under Sec. 9.31(e)?`,
                    options: [`Yes, they must always retreat if possible.`, `No, a person in this situation is not required to retreat before using force.`, `Only if the other person is unarmed.`, `Only if they are in a vehicle.`],
                    answer: `No, a person in this situation is not required to retreat before using force.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.31(e) is the 'Stand Your Ground' provision for non-deadly force. It removes the duty to retreat in this scenario.`

                {
                    question: `Under Sec. 9.32, a person is justified in using *deadly force* if they are justified under 9.31 AND reasonably believe deadly force is immediately necessary to protect against unlawful deadly force OR...`,
                    options: [`To prevent the imminent commission of any felony.`, `To prevent the imminent commission of arson.`, `To prevent the imminent commission of aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.`, `To prevent the imminent commission of theft from their vehicle.`],
                    answer: `To prevent the imminent commission of aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.32(a)(2)(B) lists these specific, violent offenses. Preventing other offenses (like arson or theft) falls under protection of property (9.42), not self-defense.`

                    question: `An actor is legally present in their driveway, is not engaged in criminal activity, and did not provoke a fight. Is the actor required to retreat before using *deadly force* under Sec. 9.32(c)?`,
                    options: [`Yes, deadly force always requires retreat if possible.`, `Only if they can safely get inside their house.`, `No, a person in this situation is not required to retreat before using deadly force.`, `No, but only because they are on their 'habitation' property.`],
                    answer: `No, a person in this situation is not required to retreat before using deadly force.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.32(c) is the 'Stand Your Ground' provision for deadly force. The location (park, driveway, etc.) doesn't matter as long as the actor 'has a right to be present.'`

                    options: [`The actor must have a special relationship with the third person.`, `The actor reasonably believes their intervention is immediately necessary AND they would be justified under 9.31/9.32 if they were in the third person's shoes.`, `The third person must be facing deadly force.`, `The third person must verbally request help.`],
                    answer: `The actor reasonably believes their intervention is immediately necessary AND they would be justified under 9.31/9.32 if they were in the third person's shoes.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 9.33 has two prongs: (1) the actor 'stands in the shoes' of the person they are protecting, and (2) reasonably believes intervention is immediately necessary.`
