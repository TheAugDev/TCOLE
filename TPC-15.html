                    question: `Renunciation is *NOT* voluntary if it is motivated by... (Sec. 15.04(c))`,

                    answer: `Criminal Attempt to commit Robbery.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 15.05 states that attempting, conspiring, or soliciting a *preparatory offense* is not an offense. Robbery is not a preparatory offense, so "Attempt to commit Robbery" is a valid charge (under 15.01).`

                    explanation: `Sec. 15.04(b) adds a higher burden for conspiracy/solicitation. Just "abandoning" (like in 15.04a) is not enough; you must actively *prevent* the crime you set in motion.`

                    answer: `Criminal Conspiracy to commit Criminal Attempt.`,
                    explanation: `Sec. 15.05 prohibits "compounding" preparatory offenses. Criminal Attempt is a preparatory offense, so conspiring to commit it is not an offense.`
